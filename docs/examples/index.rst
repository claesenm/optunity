===========

Here you can find a variety of examples to illustrate how Optunity can be useed in tandem with other machine learning software.

We have split the examples per language and library. Jump to:

-  Python
-  R
-  MATLAB

.. 
    To add examples: add them to the correct subfolder by language.
    If you plan to make several examples involving a specific package, make a subfolder for that package name,
    and add a rst file with its name that links to the subdirectory (cfr. python/sklearn.rst for an example).
