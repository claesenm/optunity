Optunity
===========

Optunity is a library containing various optimizers for hyperparameter tuning.
Hyperparameter tuning is a recurrent problem in machine learning. Optunity
provides several distinct approaches to solve such problems.

For more information, please refer to the following pages:

The Optunity library is implemented in Python and allows straightforward
integration in other machine learning environments, including R, MATLAB.

Optunity is developed at the STADIUS lab of the dept. of electrical engineering
at KU Leuven (ESAT). Optunity is free software, using a BSD license.
